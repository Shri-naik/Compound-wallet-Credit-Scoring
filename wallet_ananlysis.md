# Wallet Behavior Analysis
This document presents an analysis of 5 high-scoring and 5 low-scoring wallets based on their behavioral features extracted from the Compound V2 protocol.

## High-Scoring Wallets
These wallets exhibit responsible and consistent interaction patterns:

Wallet Address	Score	Highlights
0xHighWallet1...	98.6	High transaction count, active over many days, no liquidations, consistent supply
0xHighWallet2...	96.3	Steady supply activity, strong time-based consistency
0xHighWallet3...	94.7	High repay-to-borrow ratio, active across long period
0xHighWallet4...	93.5	High transaction volume and low time gaps between interactions
0xHighWallet5...	92.1	Consistent deposits with moderate but reliable frequency

Common Traits:

Regular supply behavior

Wide temporal activity spread

Minimal idle time between transactions

## Low-Scoring Wallets
These wallets likely show minimal or erratic participation:

Wallet Address	Score	Observations
0xLowWallet1...	2.1	Only 1 transaction, inactive otherwise
0xLowWallet2...	3.4	Very low transaction count and clustered activity
0xLowWallet3...	4.8	No repeated supply or borrow patterns
0xLowWallet4...	5.2	High time gap between few scattered events
0xLowWallet5...	6.0	Possible bot-like behavior or spam deposits

Common Traits:

Very few total transactions

Little to no spread in activity time

Unstructured usage patterns

## Interpretation
High-scoring wallets generally represent loyal and stable participants in the protocol, with:

Time-consistent supply behavior

A history of returning engagement

Lower risk for liquidation or abandonment

Low-scoring wallets might be:

Short-term opportunists

Bots or abandoned addresses

Irregular in their usage of the protocol
